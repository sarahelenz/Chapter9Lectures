/* Write the class RightTriangle. The fields of the class 
 * are integers which represent the sides of the triangle.
 * Name the fields a,b and c where a and b are the legs of
 * the triangle and c is the hypotenuse. Each of the fields
 * should be private since it makes no sense for the side
 * lengths to be negative. Write three constructors. The first
 * is a default (no argument) constructor in which each field 
 * is initialized to an appropriate value. Second, write an
 * argument constructor which receives all three sides of
 * the triangle in order. Again, make sure they are appropriate
 * values. The third, write a copy constructor. Then write the
 * setters and getters for each field.
